This is an R project created with projectR. 

Gets data from wikipedia for processing around policies, etc. 

Functions are mostly nicely documented thanks to Claude. 


1. wiki_get_article_state.R has two functions, `wiki_get_article_state` gets the closest revision ID for an article given a particular talk edit, `wiki_get_edit` gets the revision or diff for an article given a particular edit ID, or pair of times. Both should work but aren't properly tested.

I was going to use this to link from the main tables to the articles for analysis purposes.
